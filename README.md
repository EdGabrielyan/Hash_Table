# PHP Hash Table Implementation

This repository provides a simple **Hash Table** (also known as a Hash Map) implementation in **pure PHP**. It demonstrates how key-value pairs can be stored, retrieved, and managed efficiently using hashing.

## 🔍 What is a Hash Table?

A Hash Table is a data structure that stores data in an associative manner. In a hash table, data is stored in an array format, where each data value has a unique key associated with it. Accessing data is extremely fast if you know the key.
